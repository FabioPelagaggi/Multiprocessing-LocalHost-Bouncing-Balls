This software was developed to demonstrate, in a visual way, the functioning of multiprocessing in Python. Recommended using process management tools, such as ProcessExplorer, to better visualize the behavior of processes in the system.
The software creates multiples processes by spawning an client process, using Socket Python Module,  to processes the ball movement of each ball by demand. Therefore, creating multiples processes.
